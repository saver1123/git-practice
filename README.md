# git-practice
A repo for myself to practice git operations.

git clone: download a repo from Github\
git checkout -b {branch_name}: create a new branch\
git checkout {branch_name}: switch to another branch\
git commit -am "message": make a local commit\
git push: push it to the remote repo\

# Merge a branch:
git checkout main: go to the branch you want to merge to\
git merge my_branch: merge content in my_branch to main
